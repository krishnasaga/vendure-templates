## Frequently Asked Questions

- [Can I deploy the application in different environment (e.g Netlify, Fastify, etc. etc)?](#can-i-host-the-application-in-my-environment-or-is-limited-to-cloudflare)
- [Why can I not reach my remote server?](#why-can-i-not-reach-my-remote-server)

- [What payment systems are supported?](#what-payment-systems-are-supported)

### Can I host the application in my environment or is limited to Cloudflare?

We are using Cloudflare, but there isn't a specific Cloudflare feature for this application.
If you want to deploy your application in a different environment, you can follow the [Qwik guide](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/deployments/#add-an-adapter) and customize the code base according to your needs.

### Why can I not reach my remote server?

When running the storefront make sure when in dev mode (ie: using vite) to attach it to the network by using `--host 0.0.0.0`
For example: `"start": "vite --open --mode ssr --port 80 --host 0.0.0.0",`

Also make sure your firewall allows traffic on your selected port.
For Ubuntu: `sudo ufw status` to see what is blocked or allowed.

### Why does signup or login not work?

https needs to be enabled, please confirm you are using ssl. You can use apache or nginx to forward ssl traffic to your selected port.

Make sure that your vendure instance is accessible and not being blocked by a firewall for example.

If you see a message on signup "Account registration is not supported by the demo Vendure instance. In order to use it, please connect to your own local / production instance." This is simply a static message, it is not doing any actual check. Simply remove this message. To connect to your vendure instance simply set the .env variables to point to your vendure setup.

### What payment systems are supported?

Currently Braintree and Stripe are supported on the frontend, but not currently Mollie.
For Braintree make sure to name your payment method in your vendure admin "braintree payment" and specifically code "braintree-payment".

## Development

Development mode uses [Vite's development server](https://vitejs.dev/). During development, the `dev` command will server-side render (SSR) the output.

```shell
pnpm start
```

> Note: during dev mode, Vite may request a significant number of `.js` files. This does not represent a Qwik production build.

## Preview

The preview command will create a production build of the client modules, a production build of `src/entry.preview.tsx`, and run a local server. The preview server is only for convenience to locally preview a production build, and it should not be used as a production server.

```shell
pnpm preview # or `yarn preview`
```

## Production

The production build will generate client and server modules by running both client and server build commands. Additionally, the build command will use Typescript to run a type check on the source code.

```shell
pnpm build # or `yarn build`
```

## i18n

### Marking string for translation

Any string can be marked for translation by using the `$localize` template function like so:

```typescript
export default component$((props: { name: string }) => {
	return <span>{$localize`Hello ${props.name}!`}</span>;
});
```

### Extracting string for translation

The first step in translation is to build the application. Once the artifacts are build the strings can be extracted for translation.

```bash
pnpm build.client
pnpm i18n-extract
```

The result of the commands is `src/locale/message.en.json`.

### Translating strings

Take the resulting string and send them for translation. Produce a file for each language. For example:

```bash
src/locale/message.en.json    # Original strings
src/locale/message.es.json
```

### Sorting translations

Qwik hashes bundles based on the content of the files. This means that if a file changes, the order of i18n translations will be lost and can be difficult to manage manually.

```bash
pnpm i18n-sort
```

The `i18n-sort` script will sort by first appearance in the src folder to keep a consistent order.

### Testing translations

The resulting language should match your browser language. You can also override the language by adding ?lang=es to the URL.

## Static Site Generator (Node.js)

Be sure to configure your server to serve very long cache headers for the `build/**/*.js` files.

Typically you'd set the `Cache-Control` header for those files to `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.

```shell
yarn build.server
```

## Netlify

This starter site is configured to deploy to [Netlify Edge Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/overview/), which means it will be rendered at an edge location near to your users.

### Local development

The [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) can be used to preview a production build locally. To do so: First build your site, then to start a local server, run:

1. Install Netlify CLI globally `npm i -g netlify-cli`.
2. Build your site with both ssr and static `yarn build`.
3. Start a local server with `yarn serve`.
   In this project, `yarn serve` uses the `netlify dev` command to spin up a server that can handle Netlify's Edge Functions locally.
4. Visit [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/) to check out your site.

### Edge Functions Declarations

[Netlify Edge Functions declarations](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/declarations/)
can be configured to run on specific URL patterns. Each edge function declaration associates
one site path pattern with one function to execute on requests that match the path. A single request can execute a chain of edge functions from a series of declarations. A single edge function can be associated with multiple paths across various declarations.

This is useful to determine if a page response should be Server-Side Rendered (SSR) or
if the response should use a static-site generated (SSG) `index.html` file instead.

By default, the Netlify Edge adaptor will generate a `.netlify/edge-middleware/manifest.json` file, which is used by the Netlify deployment to determine which paths should, and should not, use edge functions.

To override the generated manifest, you can [add a declaration](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/declarations/#add-a-declaration) to the `netlify.toml` using the `[[edge_functions]]` config. For example:

```toml
[[edge_functions]]
  path = "/admin"
  function = "auth"
```

### Addition Adapter Options

Netlify-specific option fields that can be passed to the adapter options:

- `excludedPath` this option accepts a `string` glob pattern that represents which path pattern should not go through the generated Edge Functions.

### Deployments

You can [deploy your site to Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/) either via a Git provider integration or through the Netlify CLI. This starter site includes a `netlify.toml` file to configure your build for deployment.

#### Deploying via Git

Once your site has been pushed to your Git provider, you can either link it [in the Netlify UI](https://app.netlify.com/start) or use the CLI. To link your site to a Git provider from the Netlify CLI, run the command:

```shell
netlify link
```

This sets up [continuous deployment](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#deploy-with-git) for your site's repo. Whenever you push new commits to your repo, Netlify starts the build process..

#### Deploying manually via the CLI

If you wish to deploy from the CLI rather than using Git, you can use the command:

```shell
netlify deploy --build
```

You must use the `--build` flag whenever you deploy. This ensures that the Edge Functions that this starter site relies on are generated and available when you deploy your site.

Add `--prod` flag to deploy to production.
