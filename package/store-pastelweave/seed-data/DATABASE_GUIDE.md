# Handling SQLite Database Locking Issues

## Common Issues

When running the import script, you might encounter "database is locked" errors. This is a common issue with SQLite databases when multiple operations try to write to the database at once.

## Solutions

### 1. Use the Enhanced Import Script

The updated script includes improved handling for database locks:
- Increased delays between operations
- Exponential backoff for retries
- Better error handling

### 2. Run Database Maintenance
